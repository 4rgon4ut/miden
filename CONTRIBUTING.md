# Contributing to Miden

#### First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

You can find a detailed explanation of main project concepts in [docs](https://maticnetwork.github.io/miden/).

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a [bug](https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden/issues/new)
- Take part in [discussions](https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden/discussions)
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new [features](https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden/issues/new)

&nbsp;

## Flow 
We are using [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests.

### Versioning
We use [semver](https://semver.org/) naming convention.

### Branching
- The current active branch is `next`. Every branch with fix/feature must be forked from `next`.

- Branch name should contain a short issue/feature decription separated with hyphens [(kebab-case)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case). 

For example, if the issue title is `Fix functionality X in component Y` then branch name will be smth like: `fix-x-in-y`.

- New branch should be rebased from next before submitting a PR in case there have been changes to avoid merge commits.
i.e. this branches state:
```
          A---B---C fix-x-in-y
         /
    D---E---F---G next
            |   |
         (F, G) changes happened after `fix-x-in-y` forked
```
should become this after rebase:
```
                  A'--B'--C' fix-x-in-y
                 /
    D---E---F---G next
```
More about rebase [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) and [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase#:~:text=What%20is%20git%20rebase%3F,of%20a%20feature%20branching%20workflow.)


- Also would be good to squash commits to logically separated, distinguishable stages to keep git log clean.
i.e. 
```
7hgf8978g9... Added A to X \
                            \  (squash)
gh354354gh... oops, typo --- * ---------> 9fh1f51gh7... feat(X): Add A && B 
                            /      
85493g2458... Added B to X / 
                            
                            
789fdfffdf... Fixed D in Y \
                            \  (squash)
787g8fgf78... blah  blah --- * ---------> 4070df6f00... fix(Y): fixed D && C
                            /
9080gf6567... Fixed C in Y /
```

### Commit messages
Commit messages should be written in short and descriptive manere, prefixed with changes type and scope(if possible) tags according to [semantic commit](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716) scheme.

### Code Style and Documentation
- For documentation in the codebase, we follow the [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/meta/doc.html) convention with no more than 100 characters per line.
- For code sections, we use code separators of 100 characters like the following:
```
// CODE SECTION HEADER
// ================================================================================
```
[Rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) and [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) linting included in CI pipeline, but, it will not be superfluous to run them locally.

&nbsp;

## Pre-PR checklist
1. Repo forked and branch created from `next` according to the naming convention.
2. Commit messages and code style follow conventions.
3. Tests added for new functionality.
4. Documentation/comments updated according to changes.
5. Clippy and Rustfmt linting passed.
6. New branch rebased from `next`.

&nbsp;

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
